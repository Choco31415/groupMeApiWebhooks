Hello!

My name is Fancy Sheep! :sheep::tophat:

I am a bot tasked with turning GroupMe API calls into regular webhook URLs.

I also come with a website using GroupMe's auth API allowing anyone to create API webhook pairs for their own groups.

## Setup
Use the following example config.json to configure your own instance:

```json
{
  "name": "Fancy Sheep",
  "avatar_url": "https://i.imgur.com/6x9eaV8.jpg",
  "client_id": "-insert id-"
}
```

## Usage
To find the group ID for a GroupMe group, reference the GroupMe API tutorial or the GroupMe bot panel (either will work).

## Contributing
Please only make pull requests off of either the dev branch or a feature branch.
